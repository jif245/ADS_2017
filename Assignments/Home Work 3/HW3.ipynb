    "Note that the rejection (or not) of the Null Hypothesys depends on the level of significance the researcher chooses. Assuming we are working with an $\\alpha= 0.05$, the regressors where we can reject the null-hypothesis that their corresponding regression coefficient is zero are 7 in total (i.e.: 0.02, 3e-15, 0.04, 0.001, 0.03, 0.045, 5e-3).\n",

    "The confidence interval contains 0 inside its range. We cannot consider, with confidence level of 95%, that the slope has relevant impact in explaining the relation between x and y. As so, 100 cannot be selected as an estimate for the slope. Also, 100 is not in the middle of the interval.\n",

    "\n",
    "d. 99%-confidence interval is [99,100]\n",
    "The estimate has to be in the middle of the estimate. Also, it depends if the range is inclusive or not. If the range is NOT inclusive, the value of the estimate cannot be 100, in any case, it should be something smaller (e.g. 99.9999)."
